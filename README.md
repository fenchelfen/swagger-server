# Microservice for city data retrieval

## Overview
This server uses an API that was generated by the [swagger-codegen](https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen) project.


It is built with the [Connexion](https://github.com/zalando/connexion) library on top of Flask,
as well as [qwikidata](https://github.com/kensho-technologies/qwikidata) for querying and
[RedisJSON](https://github.com/RedisLabsModules/rejson.git) for caching.
